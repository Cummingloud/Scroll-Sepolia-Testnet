Testing launching smart contract using solidity
PussycatToken is an ERC-20 token smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract extends the functionality of the OpenZeppelin ERC20, Ownable, and Pausable contracts to create the "PUSSYCAT" token with the ticker symbol "PUSSY". It comes with additional features like minting, burning, and allowance management.

Overview
PussycatToken is a simple and versatile token contract that offers the following features:

ERC-20 Compatibility: The contract is fully compliant with the ERC-20 standard, allowing it to be easily integrated into various Ethereum applications and exchanges.

Ownership Management: The contract includes the Ownable modifier from OpenZeppelin, enabling easy management of ownership rights.

Pause Mechanism: The Pausable contract from OpenZeppelin is utilized to enable the contract owner to pause and unpause token transfers when necessary.

Minting: The contract owner can mint new tokens and allocate them to specified addresses.

Burning: Token holders can burn their tokens, effectively reducing the total supply.

Getting Started
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
Import the necessary contracts and deploy the PussycatToken contract with the desired parameters.

Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network of your choice.

Contract Details
Name: PussycatToken
Symbol: PUSSY
Functions
constructor: Initializes the token with the name "PUSSYCAT" and symbol "PUSSY", and mints an initial supply of 69 billion tokens to the contract deployer.

mint(address to, uint256 amount): Mints new tokens and assigns them to the specified address. Only the contract owner can perform this action when the contract is not paused.

burn(uint256 amount): Burns a specific amount of tokens from the sender's balance, effectively reducing the total supply.

pause(): Pauses all token transfers. Only the contract owner can perform this action.

unpause(): Unpauses token transfers. Only the contract owner can perform this action.

setAllowance(address spender, uint256 amount): Sets the allowance of a spender to spend tokens on behalf of the sender.
